### Time Limit: 1 seconds
### Problem description
* Blaise Pascal loved maths and he got a lot of contribution into mathematics, and his name is used
to label for a triangular array of the binomial coefficients that arises in probability theory,
combinatorics, and algebra.

* Dat is a student who loves to become a mathematician. He studied about Pascal’s Triangle
properties and it was very interesting. He asked you to create a program to help him to calculate
the sum value of row nth of the triangle and the sum value of all cells in the pascal’s triangle which
is limited by n + 1 rows.

### Input:
* N: the limited number of rows in the pascal’s triangle. ( 0 <= N < 63 )
### Output:
* S1: the sum value of row nth of the triangle.
* S2: the sum value of all cells in the pascal’s triangle which is limited by n + 1 rows.
