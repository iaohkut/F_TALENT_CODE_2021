### Time Limit: 1 seconds

### Problem description
* Know you are a talent in IT programming, your best friend who is working in the field of
stock market ask you to calculate a formula as following:

* 𝑬𝒔𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒆 𝒗𝒂𝒍𝒖𝒆 = $x+\sum_{i=1}^\N (int)\frac{i!}x$ where x and n are two non negative integers.

And $(int)\frac{i!}x$ mean that we just only get the integer part of fraction.

* E.g. if i = 5 and x = 7, so we have (int) 5! / 7 = (int) 120 / 7 = (int) 17.14286 = 17

### Input:
* One line has an integer x and an integer N where (1 <= x <= 106) and (1 <= N <= 102)

### Output:
* Value of 𝑬𝒔𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒆 𝒗𝒂𝒍𝒖𝒆
