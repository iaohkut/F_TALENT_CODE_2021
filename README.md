### Advice, hints, and general information
1. The problems are not sorted by difficulty.
2. Your solution programs must read input from standard input (e.g. System.in in Java or
cin in C++) and write output to standard output (e.g. System.out in Java or cout in C++).
For further details and examples, please refer to your administrator guide and
Domjudge documentation.
3. For information about which compiler flags and versions are used, please refer to your
administrator guide. (Python 2.7.17, Oracle Java 1.8.0_144, gcc 7.5.0 (C, C++ std14)).
4. Your submissions will be run multiple times, on several different inputs. If your
submission is incorrect, the error message you get will be the error exhibited on the first
input on which you failed.
    * E.g., if your instance is prone to crash but also incorrect, your submission may
be judged as either “Wrong Answer” or “Run Time Error”, depending on which
is discovered first. The inputs for a problem will always be tested in the same
order.
5. If you think some problem is ambiguous or underspecified, you may ask the judges for
a clarification request through the Domjudge system. The most likely response is “No
comment, read problem statement”, indicating that the answer can be deduced by
carefully reading the problem statement or by checking the sample test cases given in
the problem, or that the answer to the question is simply irrelevant to solving the
problem.
6. In general we are lenient with small formatting errors in the output, in particular
whitespace errors within reason, and upper/lower case errors are often (but not always)
ignored. But not printing any spaces at all (e.g. missing the space in the string “1 2” so
that it becomes “12”) is typically not accepted. The safest way to get accepted is to
follow the output format exactly.
7. For problems with floating point output, we only require that your output is correct up
to some error tolerance. For example, if the problem requires the output to be within
either absolute or relative error of 10-4, this means that
    * If the correct answer is 0.05, any answer between 0.0499 and .0501 will be
accepted.
    * If the correct answer is 500, any answer between 499.95 and 500.05 will be
accepted.

Any reasonable format for floating point numbers is acceptable. For instance,
“17.000000”, “0.17e2”, and “17” are all acceptable ways of formatting the number 17.
For the definition of reasonable, please use your common sense.
