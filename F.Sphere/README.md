### Problem description

* Thai company is a company who produces water tank which has sphere shape. The company are
recruiting a new software engineer who will work to maintain some of their software-aided
design tools. In a test for employee candidate, they request his/her to create a small program to
compute the enclosed volume and surface area of a Sphere. Today, Lien is one of the candidates
who attend the test, but unfortunately, she doesn’t remember how to compute those properties of
a Sphere. Can you help her to solve the problem?


### Input:
* d: An integer represents the diameter of the sphere (0 < d < 109)

### Output:
1. Two real numbers:
* V: the enclosed volume of the Sphere
* A: the surface area of the Sphere
2. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn’t exceed 10−3.
