### Time Limit: 1 seconds
### Problem description
* Write a program to build an undirected graph by giving adjacency matrix.
* An isolated vertex is a vertex with degree zero; that is, a vertex that is not an endpoint of any edge.
* Your task is showing all isolated vertices of the given graph.

For example,
* Giving the adjacency matrix that used to represent undirected graph as follow:

All isolated vertices of the matrix are 6 and 8.
### Input:
* The first line contains a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) which is the number of vertex of
undirected graph.
* The next N line, each line containing N integers that represent the adjacency matrix.
### Output:
Contains 1 line:
* One line contains the list of isolated vertices of the undirected graph, each number
separated by one comma.
* If the undirected graph doesn’t have any isolated vertex, the result file will contain the
message “None”.
